###Aims & Objectives

Using the following:

* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap (version 4)
* JQuery
* Javascript

The aim of the project is to present a game of our chosing. The game must include:

* Instructions section.
* Display a message of the users score upon completion of the game.
* Include a leaderboard.


###The plan
To achieve the aims and objectives of this project, a small plan was devised where I considered:

**Type of game**: Decide upon what type of game I want to produce **e.g.** will it be a click based or a keyboard press game? As well as this, I considered the purpose of the game and how will it be played and presented?


**Features of the game**: I wanted to incorporate the features listed below to make it more user friendly and to increase the game experience.

* A reset button
* A timer
* An area which displays the users final score
* The top 3 high scores


###The Game: ATOM
After careful consideration, I decided upon designing a game which will use the keyboard arrows to navigate an object around the board.

My game is called **ATOM**, with the idea being inspired from the classic snake. The user will navigate a white **ATOM** around a board attempting to collect as many protons as possible within a set time limit of 30 seconds. 

###Functionality
This is a simple application that displays the game; ATOM. Manipulating when the content of the HTML should be displayed and hidden was achieved by using JavaScript and JQuery.
